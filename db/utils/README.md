### TODO

Just a note the work in this branch are just rough implementations I have worked on in my own time.

It does need some refactoring, but nothing major. Some of the code would be better re-organised/extracted into separate functions. For instance the JSON I/O and converters might be better of in their own module alongside the custom JSONEncoder.
